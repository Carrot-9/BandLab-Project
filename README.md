# TamaTown

TamaTown is a full stack web application designed to mimic handheld Tamagotchi's! 

# Features

You can feed, pet and play with any tamagotchi of your choice.

You can also check the Tamagotchi's stats so you can stay on top of their overall health. Users with the oldest Tamagotchi's will be featured on a leaderboard!

There are two modes: Tamagotchi Monthly and Tamagotchi Life. 

In Tamagotchi Monthly, you get a random adult Tamagotchi to take care of every month. The health of these Tamagotchi's will be evaluated using a Health Score that can range from Great, Good, Ok, Bad and Terrible. These Tamagotchi's cannot die under any circumstances.

In Tamagotchi Life, you start out with an egg that you have to raise into a healthy adult Tamagotchi. This Tamagotchi does not get reset every month and will also be evaluated using a Health Score. These Tamagotchi's can die based on the quality of your care.
